## Start Writing Code

1. Experiment with;
  a. 2D primitive shapes;
  b. variables, and;
  c. conditionals

Following along with workshop zero, i was able to understand setting up, and was really excited to even begin finding new colours. 
I have never coded before, so changing the background colour, and mixing the different RGB values was great fun. 

For my shape I went with a triangle. I honestly thought it would be easier than it was. I soon realised I had to really utilise the p5.js reference guide. After that it was pretty straight forward. 

I played around with the colours some more and made my triangle purple. I then made the triangle go black half way through the code. Following along with the workshop I also made the triangle bounce back. However, I couldn't work out how to do this at the same time, as adding the bounce back would cancel out the colour. I decide to keep the colour in the code. <br />

I forgot to forward-slash the work but I did screenshot it

I used chatGPT a couple of times for the math of the triangle, before it bounced back, needing to use the values of the outside of the canvas.

**Declaration:**

I declare that I received help with my coding from my flatmate, who is experienced with programming. Additionally, I conducted several quick Google searches to resolve issues encountered during the development process. These searches helped in understanding how to implement specific features and troubleshoot problems, especially related to p5.js, as well as getting advice from relevant forums and communities.
