## Start Writing Code

1. Experiment with;
  a. 2D primitive shapes;
  b. variables, and;
  c. conditionals

Following along with workshop zero, i was able to understand setting up, and was really excited to even begin finding new colours. 
I have never coded before, so changing the background colour, and mixing the different RGB values was great fun. 

For my shape I went with a triangle. I honestly thought it would be easier than it was. I soon realised I had to really utilise the p5.js reference guide. After that it was pretty straight forward. 

I played around with the colours some more and made my triangle purple. I then made the triangle go black half way through the code. Following along with the workshop I also made the triangle bounce back. However, I couldn't work out how to do this at the same time, as adding the bounce back would cancel out the colour. I decide to keep the colour in the code. <br />

I forgot to forward-slash the work but I did screenshot it

I used chatGPT a couple of times for the math of the triangle, before it bounced back, needing to use the values of the outside of the canvas.
